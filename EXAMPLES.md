# PEN Examples

This document serves as a workbook for PEN (Poetic Engineering Notation), illustrating how to analyze and construct poetic stanzas using structural symbols.

## Basic Examples

### "Come Healing" by Leonard Cohen

**Verse 1**
> Behold the gates of mercy / In arbitrary space
> And none of us deserving / The cruelty or the grace

**PEN:**
```text
S4 M≈ V^ R≠ D* T↔
```
*   `V^`: Starts with command "Behold".
*   `R≠`: Contrast of "cruelty" vs "grace".
*   `D*`: Domain is Divine/Cosmic.

**Verse 2**
> O solitude of longing / Where love has been confined
> Come healing of the body / Come healing of the mind

**PEN:**
```text
S4 M≈ V! R= D.>D_ T↑
```
*   `V!`: Address "O solitude".
*   `R=`: Parallel "Come healing...".
*   `D.>D_`: Shifts from Somatic (Body) to Abstract (Mind).

**Verse 4**
> O troubled dust concealing / An undivided love
> The heart beneath is teaching / To the broken heart above

**PEN:**
```text
S4 M≈ V! R≠ D~ T↓
```
*   `V!`: Address "O troubled dust".
*   `R≠`: Contrast "Beneath" vs "Above".
*   `D~`: Nature/Elemental focus.

**Verse 5**
> Let the heavens falter / Let the earth proclaim  
> Come healing of the altar / Come healing of the name  

**PEN:**
```text
S4 V^ R= D*>D*
```
*   `V^`: "Let...", "Come...".
*   `R=`: Strong parallelism.
*   `D*`: Heavens, Altar, Name (Divine/Ritual).

**Verse 6**
> O longing of the branches / To lift the little bud  
> O longing of the arteries / To purify the blood  

**PEN:**
```text
S4 V! R= D~>D.
```
*   `V!`: "O longing...".
*   `R=`: Parallel structure.
*   `D~>D.`: Shifts from "Branches/Bud" (Nature) to "Arteries/Blood" (Somatic).

**Verse 7 (Chorus/Refrain)**
> And let the heavens hear it / The penitential hymn  
> Come healing of the spirit / Come healing of the limb  

**PEN:**
```text
S4 V^ R≠ D*>D.
```
*   `V^`: "Let...", "Come...".
*   `R≠`: Contrast of "Spirit" vs "Limb" (Merism: the whole being).
*   `D*>D.`: Perfect fusion of Divine and Body.

### "Suzanne" by Leonard Cohen

**Verse 1**
> Suzanne takes you down / To her place near the river
> You can hear the boats go by / You can spend the night beside her
> And you know that she's half-crazy / But that's why you want to be there
> And she feeds you tea and oranges / That come all the way from China
> And just when you mean to tell her / That you have no love to give her
> Then she gets you on her wavelength / And she lets the river answer
> That you've always been her lover

**PEN:**
```text
S~ M≈ V. R+ D~>D@ T→
```
*   `S~`: Free verse, irregular stanzaic structure (13 lines).
*   `M≈`: Loose, conversational rhythm maintaining flow.
*   `V.`: Indicative voice—observation and witnessing ("you know," "you can hear").
*   `R+`: Accumulation of sensory images and narrative details.
*   `D~>D@`: Shifts from Nature/Elemental (river, boats) to Domestic/Social (tea, oranges from China, place).
*   `T→`: Forward narrative progression.

**Chorus**
> And you want to travel with her / And you want to travel blind
> And you know that she will trust you / For you've touched her perfect body with your mind

**PEN:**
```text
S4 M≈ V. R= D_>D. T↑
```
*   `S4`: Quatrain structure.
*   `R=`: Anaphoric repetition ("And you want... And you want... And you know").
*   `D_>D.`: Abstract/Mental (blind, mind, trust) to Somatic (perfect body).
*   `T↑`: Ascending—aspiration, transcendence through connection.

**Verse 2**
> And Jesus was a sailor / When he walked upon the water
> And he spent a long time watching / From his lonely wooden tower
> And when he knew for certain / Only drowning men could see him
> He said, "All men will be sailors then / Until the sea shall free them"
> But he himself was broken / Long before the sky would open
> Forsaken, almost human / He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

**PEN:**
```text
S~ M≈ V. R: D*>D~ T↓
```
*   `S~`: Free verse (12 lines).
*   `V.`: Indicative—narrative of Jesus as witnessed myth.
*   `R:`: Extended metaphor (Jesus as sailor; drowning as salvation).
*   `D*>D~`: Divine/Cosmic (Jesus, sky, forsaken) to Nature/Elemental (water, sea, stone).
*   `T↓`: Descending—"sank," "broken," entropy and embodiment.

**Verse 3**
> Now Suzanne takes your hand / And she leads you to the river
> She is wearing rags and feathers / From Salvation Army counters
> And the sun pours down like honey / On our lady of the harbour
> And she shows you where to look / Among the garbage and the flowers
> There are heroes in the seaweed / There are children in the morning
> They are leaning out for love / And they will lean that way forever
> While Suzanne holds the mirror

**PEN:**
```text
S~ M≈ V. R≠ D@>D~ T↔
```
*   `S~`: Free verse (13 lines).
*   `V.`: Indicative witness—"she shows you."
*   `R≠`: Antithesis throughout (rags/feathers, garbage/flowers, heroes/seaweed).
*   `D@>D~`: Domestic/Social (Salvation Army, harbour) to Nature/Elemental (river, seaweed, sun).
*   `T↔`: Balanced—reflection and stasis ("holds the mirror," "lean that way forever").

**Song-Level Observation:**
The song operates with cyclical structure: verse-chorus-verse-chorus-verse-chorus. Each verse explores a different facet of spiritual-physical union, using Suzanne, Jesus, and finally Suzanne-as-mirror. The choruses provide anaphoric anchoring with consistent quatrain form while verses remain free-flowing, mirroring the river motif.


### "Hallelujah" by Leonard Cohen

**Verse 1**
> Now I've heard there was a secret chord / That David played and it pleased the Lord
> But you don't really care for music, do ya?
> It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth / The minor fall, the major lift
> The baffled king composing Hallelujah

**PEN:**
```text
S6 M= V. R: D*>D_ T→
```
*   `S6`: Sextet (6-line stanza).
*   `M=`: Regular meter (Iambic/Waltz time).
*   `V.`: Indicative narrative voice ("I've heard," "It goes").
*   `R:`: Meta-commentary/Description ("The fourth, the fifth" describes the music itself).
*   `D*>D_`: Divine (David, Lord) shifts to Abstract/Technical (Chord, Fourth, Fifth).
*   `T→`: Forward narrative progression.

**Chorus**
> Hallelujah, Hallelujah / Hallelujah, Hallelujah

**PEN:**
```text
S4 M= V! R= D* T↑
```
*   `S4`: Quatrain structure.
*   `V!`: Exclamation/Praise (Apostrophe).
*   `R=`: Repetition.
*   `D*`: Divine domain.
*   `T↑`: Ascending praise.

**Verse 2**
> Your faith was strong but you needed proof / You saw her bathing on the roof
> Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
> She tied you to a kitchen chair / She broke your throne and she cut your hair
> And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

**PEN:**
```text
S6 M= V. R≠ D*>D. T↓
```
*   `S6`: Sextet.
*   `R≠`: Antithesis (Faith vs Proof, Throne vs Kitchen chair).
*   `D*>D.`: Shifts from Divine/Cosmic (Faith, Throne) to Somatic/Body (Bathing, Hair, Lips).
*   `T↓`: Descending—"overthrew," "tied," "broke," "cut."

**Verse 3**
> You say I took the name in vain / I don't even know the name
> But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya?
> There's a blaze of light in every word / It doesn't matter which you heard
> The holy or the broken Hallelujah

**PEN:**
```text
S6 M= V. R≠ D_>D* T↔

> With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

**PEN:**

*   `R≠`: Contrast (Feel vs Touch).
*   `D.>D*`: Somatic (Touch, Tongue) to Divine (Lord of Song).
