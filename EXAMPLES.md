# PEN Examples

This document serves as a workbook for PEN (Poetic Engineering Notation), illustrating how to analyze and construct poetic stanzas using structural symbols.

## Basic Examples

### "Come Healing" by Leonard Cohen

**Verse 1**
> Behold the gates of mercy / In arbitrary space
> And none of us deserving / The cruelty or the grace

**PEN:**
```text
S4 M≈ V^ R≠ D* T↔
```
*   `V^`: Starts with command "Behold".
*   `R≠`: Contrast of "cruelty" vs "grace".
*   `D*`: Domain is Divine/Cosmic.

**Verse 2**
> O solitude of longing / Where love has been confined
> Come healing of the body / Come healing of the mind

**PEN:**
```text
S4 M≈ V! R= D.>D_ T↑
```
*   `V!`: Address "O solitude".
*   `R=`: Parallel "Come healing...".
*   `D.>D_`: Shifts from Somatic (Body) to Abstract (Mind).

**Verse 4**
> O troubled dust concealing / An undivided love
> The heart beneath is teaching / To the broken heart above

**PEN:**
```text
S4 M≈ V! R≠ D~ T↓
```
*   `V!`: Address "O troubled dust".
*   `R≠`: Contrast "Beneath" vs "Above".
*   `D~`: Nature/Elemental focus.

**Verse 5**
> Let the heavens falter / Let the earth proclaim  
> Come healing of the altar / Come healing of the name  

**PEN:**
```text
S4 V^ R= D*>D*
```
*   `V^`: "Let...", "Come...".
*   `R=`: Strong parallelism.
*   `D*`: Heavens, Altar, Name (Divine/Ritual).

**Verse 6**
> O longing of the branches / To lift the little bud  
> O longing of the arteries / To purify the blood  

**PEN:**
```text
S4 V! R= D~>D.
```
*   `V!`: "O longing...".
*   `R=`: Parallel structure.
*   `D~>D.`: Shifts from "Branches/Bud" (Nature) to "Arteries/Blood" (Somatic).

**Verse 7 (Chorus/Refrain)**
> And let the heavens hear it / The penitential hymn  
> Come healing of the spirit / Come healing of the limb  

**PEN:**
```text
S4 V^ R≠ D*>D.
```
*   `V^`: "Let...", "Come...".
*   `R≠`: Contrast of "Spirit" vs "Limb" (Merism: the whole being).
*   `D*>D.`: Perfect fusion of Divine and Body.
